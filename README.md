## Online News Popularity analysis

This report is my final project for DTSA5509 Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning.
The data I used in the project was "Online News Popularity" from UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/.

This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years.
The goal is to predict the the number of shares in social networks, which indicates popularity.
Although the target variables in this dataset are continuous, they are converted into binary data using a certain criterion to determine whether or not articles went viral on social networks. So I analyzed it as a classification problem.
